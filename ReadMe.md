# Overview

I have noticed that despite being told Java is an older language and is being replaced that most positions still use Java whether due to the cost of transfering to a new system or just if it aint broke dont fix it. Because of this I wanted to learned about how to code in Java. This is the first project I have made with it.

This is a basic paint application. It will allow a user to draw on a screen using their mouse. It also has functions such as color change tools for pen or marker shapes and a few utilities such as clear the whole image, saving the image or loading an image. It passes my 5 year old testing and he had fun with it. :\)

I was able to fufil my goal of getting a basic understanding of Java. I found as I wrote this program it is very similar to C# but doesn't seem to require a background framework such as .Net to run. Overall it is a nice language to use and I look forward to having more fun building things as I get used to it.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
